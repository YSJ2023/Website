  <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>JavaScript</strong>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the <strong>ECMAScript specification</strong>. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
      <br>
      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
